AI-Powered API Documentation Assistant
This project implements an AI-powered API documentation assistant using Flask and the Transformers library from Hugging Face. The assistant allows users to query API-related questions in natural language and receive relevant documentation.

Overview
In software development, understanding and navigating through API documentation can be a challenging task. This project aims to simplify this process by leveraging artificial intelligence to provide contextual, accurate, and quick responses to developer queries about API endpoints, parameters, and usage examples.

Features
Question Answering: Utilizes a pre-trained transformer model to accurately answer questions based on provided API documentation.
Natural Language Processing: Transforms user queries into structured requests to retrieve precise information from the API documentation.
Dynamic Documentation Integration: Loads API documentation from a JSON file and dynamically generates responses based on real-time queries.
Technologies Used
Flask: Lightweight web framework for handling HTTP requests and responses in Python.
Transformers Library: State-of-the-art natural language processing library from Hugging Face for tasks such as question answering.
React: JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces, used here for the frontend application.
Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine.
Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed to manage frontend dependencies.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
Install Python dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install transformers flask flask-cors
Install Node.js dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
Running the Application
Start the Flask backend:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
# The Flask server will start on http://localhost:5000
Start the React frontend:

bash
Copy code
# In a new terminal window/tab
cd frontend
npm start
# The React development server will start on http://localhost:3000
Open your browser:
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the AI-powered API documentation assistant.

Usage
Enter a natural language query about API endpoints, parameters, or usage examples in the provided input field.
Click the "Ask" button to send the query to the backend.
The assistant will process the query and display relevant API documentation or answers.
Folder Structure
app.py: Contains the Flask backend implementation.
frontend/: Directory containing the React frontend application.
public/: Static assets and index.html.
src/: React components and application logic.
